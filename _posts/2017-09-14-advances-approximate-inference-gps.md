- title: "A Unifying Framework for Sparse Gaussian Process Approximation using Power Expectation Propagation"
  abstract: "The application of GPs is limited by computational and analytical intractabilities that arise when data are sufficiently numerous or when employing non-Gaussian models. A wealth of GP approximation schemes have been developed over the last 15 years to address these key limitations. Many of these schemes employ a small set of pseudo data points to summarise the actual data. We have developed a new pseudo-point approximation framework using Power Expectation Propagation (Power EP) that unifies a large number of these pseudo-point approximations. The new framework is built on standard methods for approximate inference (variational free-energy, EP and power EP methods) rather than employing approximations to the probabilistic generative model itself. In this way all of approximation is performed at `inference time' rather than at `modelling time' resolving awkward philosophical and empirical questions that trouble previous approaches. Crucially, we demonstrate that the new framework includes new pseudo-point approximation methods that outperform current approaches on regression, classification and state space modelling tasks in batch and online settings."
